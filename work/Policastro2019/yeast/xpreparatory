#We need to get the genome files set up before we can do anything else:
#
cd ScGENOME
source 0README
cd ..

#The downloads/stripeseq directory contains empty files with names corresponding#to the real read data files on our system.
#To reproduce our analyses, you must populate the directory with the real goods.

#The file samples.tsv assumes implicitely that the read data are accessible
#in the download/stripeseq directory under the listed file name prefixes.

#Let's set up a template Makefile to run the workflow:
#
sed -e "s#{RAWREAD1}.fq#{RAWREAD1}.fastq.gz#; s#{RAWREAD2}.fq#{RAWREAD2}.fastq.gz#;" ../GoSTRIPES/templates/Makefile_Sc >  Makefile_Sc

#And now we set up the sample directories to get the work done:
#
sed -e "s#EXPERIMENT=demo#EXPERIMENT=GSF2268#; s#{READFILESTEM\[i\]}_R1#{READFILESTEM[i]}_R1_001#; s#{READFILESTEM\[i\]}_R2#{READFILESTEM[i]}_R2_001#; " ../GoSTRIPES/templates/xsetup_samples >  xsetup_samples
chmod a+x xsetup_samples
#NOTE: You should adjust the Makefile parameters to choices that are appropriate
#      for your system. As provided, the workflow will run with 8 cores.
./xsetup_samples

#Ok, one more absolutely necessary preparatory step:
#
echo "We must set the rws variable again, as we have moved the gostripes.simg images."
echo "Execute the following (or equivalent) in your working shell:"
echo ""
echo "source ../GoSTRIPES/bin/xworkStripes -b `pwd` -i `pwd`/../gostripes.simg" 
echo ""
