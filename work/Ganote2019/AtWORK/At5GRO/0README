#Nascent RNA sequencing reveals distinct features in plant transcription.

#Prerequisites:
#
# - the AtGENOME directory in the location identified in At5GRO.configfile
#   (with processing done as specified in the AtGENOME/0README file)
#

#After the prerequisites are taken care of, execution of "xdoit" should produce
#At5GRO read pair alignments and the analysis of the mapped reads with
#TSRchitect to identify and characterize TSS and TSR.

#The easiest way to run the code is via the TSRchitect Singularity image, as
#explained in the parent directory.  Alternatively, you can change the
#At5GRO.configfile to point to local installations of required software
#packages.
