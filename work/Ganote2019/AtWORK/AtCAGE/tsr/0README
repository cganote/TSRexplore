#xrunAwf invokes the R scripts AtCAGE-wf*.Rscript.  Please see comments in those scripts with
# regard to our analyses of the AtCAGE data.  Text output is sent to file "AtCAGE-wf*.output",
# and plots are printed to file "AtCAGE-wf2.pdf".  Output file TSS* and TSR* are produced by
# TSRchitect.  For addtional data exploration, you might want to save R output from
# AtCAGE-wf*.Rscript as an *.RData file and reload; see comments in AtCAGE-wf*.Rscript.
