#AtEST
#
#Analysis of Arabidopsis EST 5'-ends to detect potential promoters.
#

#Prerequisites:
#
# - the AtGENOME directory in the location identified in AtEST.configfile
#   (with processing done as specified in the AtGENOME/0README file)
#

#After the prerequisites are taken care of, execution of "xdoit" should
#download Arabidopsis ESTs from NCBI, splice align the sequences to the
#Arabidopsis genome using GeneSeqer, and finally analysis of the alignments with
#TSRchitect to identify and characterize TSS and TSR.

#The easiest way to run the code is via the TSRchitect Singularity image, as
#explained in the parent directory.  Alternatively, you can change the
#AtEST.configfile to point to local installations of required software
#packages.
