#Analysis of Tokizawa, M., Kusunoki, K., Koyama, H., Kurotani, A., Sakurai, T.,
#Suzuki, Y., Sakamoto, T., Kurata, T., and Yamamoto, Y.Y. (2017).
#Identification of Arabidopsis genic and non-genic promoters by paired-end
#sequencing of TSS tags. Plant Journal 90, 587-605.
#
#

#Prerequisites:
#
# - the AtGENOME directory in the location identified in AtOligo.configfile
#   (with processing done as specified in the AtGENOME/0README file)
#

#After the prerequisites are taken care of, execution of "xdoit" should produce
#AtOligo read pair alignments and the analysis of the mapped reads with
#TSRchitect to identify and characterize TSS and TSR.

#The easiest way to run the code is via the TSRchitect Singularity image, as
#explained in the parent directory.  Alternatively, you can change the
#AtOligo.configfile to point to local installations of required software
#packages.
