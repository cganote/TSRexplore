#AtPEAT
#
#Analysis of Morton, T., et al (2014) The Plant Cell 26, 2746-2760.
#
#

#Prerequisites:
#
# - the AtGENOME directory in the location identified in AtPEAT.configfile
#   (with processing done as specified in the AtGENOME/0README file)
#
# - the AtPEAT/downloads directory in the location identified in
#   AtPEAT.configfile. The directory should include the MT_*.fastq read files
#   provided by the study authors. Alternatively, you can use the authors'
#   peat.sorted.bam alignment file and change scripts/xmkBAMDIR to use those
#   alignments instead of the alignments generated by xmkBAMDIR from the
#   MT_*.fastq read files.

#After the prerequisites are taken care of, execution of "xdoit" should produce
#AtPEAT read pair alignments and the analysis of the mapped reads with
#TSRchitect to identify and characterize TSS and TSR.

#The easiest way to run the code is via the TSRchitect Singularity image, as
#explained in the parent directory.  Alternatively, you can change the
#AtPEAT.configfile to point to local installations of required software
#packages.
