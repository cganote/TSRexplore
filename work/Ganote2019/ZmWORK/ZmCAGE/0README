# Some of the code for this repository, especially the trimming and alignment portions, come from modified code written by the author.
# This can be obtained as follows:
# git clone https://github.com/mariakmejiaguerra/ZmTSSs_CAGE
#- ensure all trimmed fastq files (e.g.  *_demultiplexed_trimmed_filtered.fastq) are removed prior to (re-)-running the workflow
# Be sure to download the genome assembly and gff3 file in the ZmGENOMEv3 Directory as follows:
# 'source 0README'
# Please download rRNAdust at this location: http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/suppl/rRNAdust/
#- time ./xdoit >& err
#==> job will take approximately 12 hours
