# Ready to work

Exploration of TSR presupposes that you have TSR to explore.
There are different experimental techniques for 5'-end transcript profiling.
Our computational analyses should be applicable to sequencing data from any
such techniques (both single- and paired-end read data).
The workflow involves the following basic steps:

* mapping of the read data to the relevant genome
* identifying TSS and TSR
* exploring the TSR
* (possibly) identification of transcription regulatory motifs

The following github repositories provide tools and documentation for all of
the steps (in order):

* [GoSTRIPES](https://github.com/BrendelGroup/GoSTRIPES)
* [TSRchitect](https://github.com/BrendelGroup/TSRchitect) (also available as a [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) package)
* [TSRexplore](https://github.com/BrendelGroup/TSRexplore) (this repository)
* [MoVRs](https://github.com/BrendelGroup/MoVRs)
